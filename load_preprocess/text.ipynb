Each question (\"How do I sort a dictionary by value?\") is labeled with exactly one tag (Python, CSharp, JavaScript, or Java). Your task is to develop a model that predicts the tag for a question. This is an example of multi-class classification—an important and widely applicable kind of machine learning problem."

      "Question:  b'\"my tester is going to the wrong constructor i am new to programming so if i ask a question that can be easily fixed, please forgive me. my program has a tester class with a main. when i send that to my regularpolygon class, it sends it to the wrong constructor. i have two constructors. 1 without perameters..public regularpolygon().    {.       mynumsides = 5;.       mysidelength = 30;.    }//end default constructor...and my second, with perameters. ..public regularpolygon(int numsides, double sidelength).    {.        mynumsides = numsides;.        mysidelength = sidelength;.    }// end constructor...in my tester class i have these two lines:..regularpolygon shape = new regularpolygon(numsides, sidelength);.        shape.menu();...numsides and sidelength were declared and initialized earlier in the testing class...so what i want to happen, is the tester class sends numsides and sidelength to the second constructor and use it in that class. but it only uses the default constructor, which therefor ruins the whole rest of the program. can somebody help me?..for those of you who want to see more of my code: here you go..public double vertexangle().    {.        system.out.println(\"\"the vertex angle method: \"\" + mynumsides);// prints out 5.        system.out.println(\"\"the vertex angle method: \"\" + mysidelength); // prints out 30..        double vertexangle;.        vertexangle = ((mynumsides - 2.0) / mynumsides) * 180.0;.        return vertexangle;.    }//end method vertexangle..public void menu().{.    system.out.println(mynumsides); // prints out what the user puts in.    system.out.println(mysidelength); // prints out what the user puts in.    gotographic();.    calcr(mynumsides, mysidelength);.    calcr(mynumsides, mysidelength);.    print(); .}// end menu...this is my entire tester class:..public static void main(string[] arg).{.    int numsides;.    double sidelength;.    scanner keyboard = new scanner(system.in);..    system.out.println(\"\"welcome to the regular polygon program!\"\");.    system.out.println();..    system.out.print(\"\"enter the number of sides of the polygon ==&gt; \"\");.    numsides = keyboard.nextint();.    system.out.println();..    system.out.print(\"\"enter the side length of each side ==&gt; \"\");.    sidelength = keyboard.nextdouble();.    system.out.println();..    regularpolygon shape = new regularpolygon(numsides, sidelength);.    shape.menu();.}//end main...for testing it i sent it numsides 4 and sidelength 100.\"\\n'\n",

Carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe, and Aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance. I, for one, don\\'t consider her to be either ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history. See if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor: I was rolling over this one.

When the show was over, I thought \"This is probably the best thing on TV I will ever see in my life.\" 42 years later, that has held true. There is still nothing so amazing, so honestly astonishing as the talent that was displayed here. You can talk about all the super-stars you want to, this is the most superlative of them all!<br /><br />You name it, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, sultry seduction, ballads, Barbra is truly a story-teller. Her ability to pull off anything she attempts is legendary. But this special was made in the beginning, and helped to create the legend that she quickly became. In spite of rising so far in such a short time, she has fulfilled the promise, revealing more of her talents as she went along. But they are all here from the very beginning. You will not be disappointed in viewing this.'\n",

Anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly utter nonsense.<br /><br />Creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects. The actors are highly believable, the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing. <br /><br />There is much mystique in this film. Many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels. How was 'Craig' created and what happened to him?<br /><br />A fantastic film with a large chill factor. A film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch.<br /><br />Look forward to more of these fantastic films!!\"\n",

The interviews aren't very interesting and no real insight is offered. The footage isn't assembled in a very informative way, either. It's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features. One thing I'll say is that Isabella Rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets.
